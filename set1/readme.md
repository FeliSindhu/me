**My Journal**

Useful notes : 
- always put "git console" before forking and copy or, before putting the link from github.
- to run the tests (which shows what are the things that needs to be completed), use = "python3 ../course/set2/tests.py"
- to check the state of your git commits: "git status"

**Thoughts on this course**
To be honest, it's complicated doing these install and other stuff, but lets be positive and hope I can do this course just fine :)
